# USA-Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis

As part of my A-level economics course, I was required to research the market share of EV manufacturers in the USA. Since I was unable to find any recent data, I decided to analyse a large dataset obtained from the<a href="data.gov">US Government's Open Database</a> and generate my own figures for the EV market share in the USA. Given the vast size of the dataset, I wrote a Python script to analyse the data and extract relevant statistics.
