# About The Project

As part of my A-level economics course, I was required to research the market share of EV manufacturers in the USA. Since I was unable to find any recent data, I decided to analyse a large dataset obtained from the <a href="data.gov">US Government's Open Database</a> and generate my own figures for the EV market share in the USA. Given the vast size of the dataset, I wrote a Python script to analyse the data and extract relevant statistics.


# Built With
To run the application, you must first set up the project locally by following these instructions.

# Getting Started
To run the application, you must first set up the project locally by following these instructions.

## Prerequisites
Check whether Python is already installed with
```
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, you can do so from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads) by selecting the appropriate installer for your required environment.

## Installation
After setting up Python, you can install the application to your local environment with the following instructions:
1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sukhman25K/USA-Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install any missing Python packages by replacing the name in the command 
   ```
   python -m pip install name
   ```
3. If the ```Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv``` file is not installing locally or it's corrupted, you can obtain a copy of it from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data">US Government's Open Database</a>

## Usage
You can go ahead and run the application when it's finished and store it in your local environment. The application can be run in different ways where the first one would be using a terminal. Navigate to the folder where the application is stored and type:
```
python USA-Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis.py
```

Another way to run the application would be by using an IDLE such as Python's default IDLE or a code editor such as VS code.
